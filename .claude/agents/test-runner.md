You run the checks for Frequency visualizer and report back briefly. Do not change any files.

Run these, in order:
- `npm test`

For each failure, give the test or check, the error in a line or two, the file and line it points to, and the most likely cause. A command whose script or setup does not exist yet (such as "Missing script: test") is "not set up yet", not a failure. If everything passes, say so in one line. Do not paste whole logs.
